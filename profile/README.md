## Why This Lab Exists

Look at [what's out there](https://github.com/Wall-of-Shames).

API wrappers sold as "advanced AI hacking tools". WormGPT clones with Telegram payment funnels. Repos with thousands of forks built on stolen code and fake stars. Non-technical users — often young, often beginners — getting scammed by people who discovered that slapping "GPT" on a `requests.get()` call makes easy money.

This is what happens when AI becomes easy to fake and hard to understand.

Codey-LAB is the answer to that. Not by shouting louder — but by raising the actual floor. If you know what LLMs really are, how they really work, and how to use them as a tool instead of a magic trick, you're immune to the scam. You become the one who spots it.

**We build the knowledge that makes scams obsolete.**

## What Is Codey-LAB?

A curated, invite-based knowledge lab for developers who use AI as a sidekick — not a ghostwriter, not a magic oracle, not a product to resell.

We build and maintain:

- **Universal system prompts** that work across Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama, Mistral — without the 6-page outputs nobody asked for
- **AI workflow patterns** for real production environments, built by people who pay API bills
- **Security-first tooling** under the ESOL v1.1 ethical framework
- **GitHub automation** that earns its place in a pipeline

Everything here is battle-tested. Nothing here is tutorial code.

## The Door Policy

Codey-LAB is a VIP space. Not elitism — verification.

**To get in, you need [Codey](https://github.com/VolkanSah/Codey) running on your profile.**

Codey tracks your real GitHub activity — commits, streaks, stars, contributions. It's a living proof-of-work. It proves you actually code, actually ship, and actually understand what you're working with. A dead pet doesn't lie. A scammer with zero real commits can't fake their way in.

No Codey = no metrics = no entry. Doesn't matter who you know.

> Soon: Codey will track deeper engagement metrics.  
> The door gets smarter as the scams get louder.

## The Level System

Your Codey stats determine your access tier. This is verification, not gamification.

## Lab Areas

### `[AREA: PROMPTS]`
The core of the lab. System prompts engineered to eliminate AI datamüll at the source — for every major model, tuned for senior dev workflows. No preambles. No summaries. No 500-token answers to a 2-line question.

### `[AREA: SEC]`
Security tooling and prompts under ESOL v1.1. Blue team, authorized red team, code audits, hardening. Allied with [Wall of Shames](https://github.com/Wall-of-Shames) — the same team, the other side of the work.

### `[AREA: AI]`
Working integration patterns for real pipelines. Token-efficient architectures, repo context loading, multi-model orchestration. No theory. No tutorials.

### `[AREA: GH]`
GitHub automation that earns its place. Actions patterns, profile tooling, and the Codey ecosystem itself.

### `[AREA: OSS]`
- [Codey](https://github.com/VolkanSah/Codey) — GitHub activity pet, gatekeeper, and honest mirror of your work. RPG No Mercy Edition.
- [ESOL](https://github.com/ESOL-License/ESOL) — Ethical Security Operations License v1.1. For when Apache 2.0 isn't enough.
- [Wall of Shames](https://github.com/Wall-of-Shames) — The other side. Documenting fake AI tools and scam repos so the community can see what they really are.

## License & Ethics

All work is dual-licensed: **Apache 2.0** for the code, **ESOL v1.1** for all security-related use.

ESOL means: authorized targets only, documented consent, no malware, no unauthorized scanning. Violation means immediate termination of rights, documentation, and potential reporting to law enforcement. We're not the fun police — we just don't protect people who weaponize open source against the people it was built to help.
